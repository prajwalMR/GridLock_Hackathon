TheTrafficApp - BookMyRoute

Works like bookmyshow for roads. Allows you to book a slot on your route at a given time , showing
rest of the users the expected traffic at their route and time and hence helping them to use their 
descrition to decide which route and time to take. This would hence aid in reducing traffic jams.
The app handels merging , intersecting and diverging and sub-routes also.
